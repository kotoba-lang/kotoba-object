   The .clj suites next to this one are the JVM oracle. This file exists

   a claim that they load under ClojureScript. Until 2026-08-20 that claim was
   false: both used `*'`, which cljs cannot resolve, so the extension asserted a
   portability nothing had ever executed. A rename is not evidence; running is."
